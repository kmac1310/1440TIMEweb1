## Overview

1440TIME™ challenges the 6,000-year-old clock system by converting abstract time into concrete tokens. Every day provides exactly 1,440 minutes - the question isn't how you spend your time, but how you invest your tokens.

- **ON-TIME Calculator**: Interactive tool to calculate personal opportunity tokens
- **Dynamic Data Sync**: Calculator results update multiple sections automatically
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fully responsive design with touch-friendly interactions
- **AI Acceleration Zone**: 20% token allocation strategy for AI-powered productivity

## Technology

- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)

## Calculator Logic

The ON-TIME calculator computes available opportunity tokens by:
